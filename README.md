# rpi-kube-wordpress
A Kubernetes Wordpress project for Raspberry PI

This project is to showcase how to setup MariaDB (https://mariadb.com/), Wordpress (https://wordpress.org/), RaspberryPi (https://www.raspberrypi.org/), Metallb (https://metallb.universe.tf/), 
K3S (https://k3s.io/), and *Rancher (https://rancher.com/).

This is a work in effort to creating a Wordpress HA setup for my website, rolandcraddolph.com,  that I am hosting myself. :)


*Rancher is not really needed but useful when you are tired of typing kubectl .... and just want a visual of what is going on
